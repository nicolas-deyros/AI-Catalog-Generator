# Test Fixtures

This directory contains test fixtures used by both unit and E2E tests.

## Security Considerations

- All test files are safe and contain no sensitive data
- Images are minimal test patterns to reduce file size
- Text files contain only safe, non-executable content
- No real API keys or credentials are stored here

## File Descriptions

- `test-image.png`: Minimal 1x1 pixel test image for upload testing
- `test-file.txt`: Plain text file for testing file type validation
- `sample-products.json`: Sample product data for testing
